I miss being able to freely mix compile-time high-level code with my assembly language... If you've ever used "BBC Basic", you'll know what I'm on about.

I'm hoping that when this is done, you'll be able to freely mix JavaScript in with your assembly code and use it to calculate all sorts of stuff at `comptime`.

## Work in Progress

I wouldn't think about using this as an assembler if I were you.

When I've done it's going to be lovely... but I'm not done.

## Thank You
